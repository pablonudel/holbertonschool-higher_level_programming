# Python - Hello, World

This project is part of my software development training at Holberton School. It introduces foundational Python programming concepts and basic syntax through a series of simple scripts. Each script demonstrates a specific aspect of Python, from working with strings and numbers to slicing and concatenating text.

The goal of this project is to build a strong understanding of Python basics while emphasizing clean, readable code.

#### Learning Objectives

- How to use the Python interpreter
- How to print text and variables using print
- How to use strings
- What are indexing and slicing in Python
- What is the official Python coding style and how to check your code with pycodestyle

#### Requirements

- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.\*)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- Your code should use the [pycodestyle](https://pypi.org/project/pycodestyle/) (version 2.7.\*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc

## Tasks

#### 0. Hello, print

Write a Python script that prints exactly `"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle`, followed by a new line.

- Use the function `print`

#### 1. Print integer

Complete this [source code](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py) in order to print the integer stored in the variable `number`, followed by `Battery street`, followed by a new line.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/master/3-print_number.py)
- The output of the script should be:
  - the number, followed by `Battery street`,
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast the variable `number` into a string
- Your code must be 3 lines long
- You have to use f-strings [tips](https://realpython.com/python-f-strings/)

File: [3-print_number.py](https://github.com/pablonudel/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-hello_world/3-print_number.py)

#### 2. Print float

Complete the source code in order to print the float stored in the variable `number` with a precision of 2 digits.

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/master/4-print_float.py)
- The output of the program should be:
  - `Float:`, followed by the float with only 2 digits
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to cast `number` to string
- You have to use f-strings

File: [4-print_float.py](https://github.com/pablonudel/holbertonschool-higher_level_programming/blob/main/python-hello_world/4-print_float.py)

- You can find the source code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq/0x00.py/blob/master/5-print_string.py)
- The output of the program should be:
  - 3 times the value of `str`
  - followed by a new line
  - followed by the 9 first characters of `str`
  - followed by a new line
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statement
- Your program should be maximum 5 lines long

- You can find the source code here
- You are not allowed to use any loops or conditional statements
- Your program should be exactly 8 lines long
- `word_first_3` should contain the first 3 letters of the variable word
- `word_last_2` should contain the last 2 letters of the variable word
- `middle_word` should contain the value of the variable word without the first and last letters
